You can see which platforms Emby offers clients for download in the "Emby Apps & Devices" section of [this link](https://emby.media/download.html)


## Adding Videos via Samba Shared Folder

We open the `Video` folder in the shared folder and you can add your own **Movies** to the `Movie` folder

Here I added a `Big Buck Bunny` to the folder
