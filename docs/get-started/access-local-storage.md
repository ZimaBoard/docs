# Accessing Shared Folders from Computers and Phones

## Brief

ZimaBoard comes pre-installed with Samba, a common communication protocol for sharing files and printers over a LAN.

So, once ZimaBoard is started, the shared folders created by Samba will be automatically discovered on the LAN, whether it's your home laptop, cell phone, router, or big TV.

Of course, all the pre-made scripts are simply configuring some shared areas in the ZimaBoard file system. If you need advanced requirements, you can check [Samba extended configuration information]()

## Accessing from Computers

### macOS Accessing

#### Auto-discovery of LAN disks

1. Open the **Finder**

::: tip

Here are the default locations of these shared folders in ZimaBoard

- Downloads: /media/Volume1/downloads
- Music: /media/Volume1/Music
- Video: /media/Volume1/Video

You can reconfigure the shared folder path and name via /etc/samba/smb.config, refer to [Samba extended configuration information]() for details

### Android Accessing

In Android phones, we tested several file managers (ES File Explorer, Xiaomi File Explorer, File Geek, CX File Manager, etc.).

We recommend "**CX File Manager**", which is a small, beautiful, ad-free file manager that can easily connect to many types of shared drives.

Download CX File Manager：
[Download via Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer), 
[Direct Download APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/cx-file-explorer/)，

See it all in one picture:

![CX File Explorer Network](./images/cxfe-network.jpeg)

3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the "**REMOTE**" page, and select the "**SMB**" option

At this point, I kinda want to access the files on the home server [by remote login]() (corresponding to the tutorial under development...)
