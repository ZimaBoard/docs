## Community

Casa is derived from the Spanish word for "home".
The CasaOS project originated as a pre-installed system for IceWhale's hardware product ZimaBoard.

After researching a large number of operating systems and software on the market, the team found that there was no server system designed for home scenarios.

So, we chose to launch this open source project to develop CasaOS with our friends in the community and you.
